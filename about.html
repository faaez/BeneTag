    <h1>What is BeneTag?</h1>
    <h3><p>BeneTag is a new ecosystem where products do not die when they leave the store front- the BeneTag on your
    product takes you to its BeneTag page which tells you more about where the product was made, what went into making it,
    the working conditions it was made in, and for some companies, even something about the person who made it!
    </br></br>
    BeneTag not only creates a more personal connection between the consumer and the producer of the product, but also 
    promotes ethical buying by showcasing the conditions a product was made in.</p></h3>
